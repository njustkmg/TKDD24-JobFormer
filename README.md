# JobFormer: Skill-Aware Job Recommendation with Semantic-Enhanced Transformer

This is the official PyTorch implementation of the paper "**JobFormer: Skill-Aware Job Recommendation with Semantic-Enhanced Transformer**". 

ðŸ’¥ In real-world management scenarios, job recommendation faces challenges due to the information deficit of JDs and the heterogeneity between JDs and user profiles. To tackle these challenges, we propose a skill-aware recommendation model based on a semantic-enhanced Transformer, which models JD-related items, leverages a local-global attention mechanism to capture intra- and inter-job dependencies, and adopts a two-stage learning strategy that utilizes skill distributions for JD representation learning in recall and integrates user profiles for final ranking.
